Wanted Features and Bugs to Fix in GenericChat

- [DONE]Test chat lengths
- [DONE]Break out message formatting from keyboard input
- [DONE]Correctly format up 256 characters of text by breaking into lines
- [DONE]Handle display of very long user names
- [DONE]limit the length of usernames (now set to 32 characters)
- Very long messages may currently not display the last little bit if the player has a long user name
- Add a cursor to the client
- Make display for input text in client scroll with the cursor as the line extends past the 64 character limit of the box
- Add ability to move cursor position with arrow keys while in chat mode
- Make sure odd utility keys (left super, right ctrl, etc) do not print to the chat line when pressed
- [IN PROGRESS]Better comments, everywhere
- Test across a network, not just localhost
- [DONE]must test for the existance of log files and create them if they don't exist before trying to open them (currently, I just created the directories manually.  However, the user could delete these, so they need to be built on startup)
